Setup:

Race Mode uses a custom starting save file, for the time being.

This save file can be found in the Randomizer download, in the folder titled "RaceModeSave". 

Note that this save file is worthless without a legitimate copy of the game dumped from your own Nintendo Switch, which will not be provided by the Randomizer.

See the setup guide for direction on how to dump the ROM from your own copy.

CONSOLE: Use a homebrew save file manager and place the save file in the correct spot on your SD card.

EMULATOR: To use this custom starting save file, place it in the emulator file path \nand\user\save\0000000000000000\BF50755B382CCC6AC0A69D441CBBF62C\0100E95004038000 .

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Race Mode:

The intent of Race Mode is to allow for the player to experience the joys of the normal game, in a shorter single playsession, aiming for 3-4 hours for experienced individuals. This is accomplished by reducing the amount of grinding and reducing the portion of the story that you play through (to smaller chunks called Storylines). Most of your character's power in Race Mode will come from the custom loot tables given to the Treasure Chests on the Continents with the Storylines you are required to complete. You could even have a friendly race between people on the same seed, and compete to see who finishes the game first!

To import those settings, copy the settings string into the field next to the "Settings" label at the bottom of the randomizer.

To begin Race Mode when in game, click the "Race Mode Start" option on the main menu.

The save file starts in NG+, so you have access to your Hidden Skill Trees and Pneuma from the start of the game.

The difficulty level of the game is set to and stuck at a minimum of Normal. (The values for Easy have been changed to match Normal.)

------------------------------------------------------------

Storylines:

You have to complete 4 Storylines to unlock access to the end of the game, where you win by defeating Artifice Aion.

To start the first Storyline, talk to the NPC called Spraine, located near the Maelstrom.

Completing one Storyline will automatically warp you via cutscene to the new continent containing the next required Storyline.

The 4 Storylines are selected from the following:

1 of either Gormott (Defeat Morag after rescuing Nia) or Uraya (Defeat Akhos and Malos)
1 of either Mor Ardain (Defeat Patroka and Mikhail) or Leftherian Archipelago (Defeat Zeke)
1 of either Indoline Praetorium + Temperantia (Defeat Giga Rosa) or Tantal (Defeat Jin) or Spirit Crucible Elpys (Defeat Phantasms)
1 of either Cliffs of Morytha + Land of Morytha (Defeat Infernal Guldo) or World Tree (Defeat Amalthus)

------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe each of the Race Mode suboptions, which are all recommended to be enabled to get the full Race Mode experience. Other settings in other tabs can be turned on or off as you desire.

------------------------------------------------------------

Zohar Fragment Hunt:

In order to complete a Storyline, you also must find 3-6 Mysterious Parts (depending on the total number of chests in that area) from that Storyline section. These can be found in treasure chests throughout the continents the given Storyline takes place on. You will not be able to progress past the final quest in a Storyline without finding these items. Roughly 1/3rd of the chests on the Storyline area contain a Mysterious Part for that area.

------------------------------------------------------------

DLC Item Removal:

If this option is enabled, the DLC gifts will all be replaced with 1G each, except for the DLC Quests, and 60000 Ether Crystals for Poppi.

------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe some additional features for Race Mode which are always enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------

Less Grinding:

When you warp to a new Continent, the landmark that you appear near when you spawn in will give massively increased XP, in an attempt to bridge the power level gap between the two continents. You can only use this XP by resting at an Inn and leveling up that way, so it is a good idea to go to a previous inn and level up immediately. 

!! For Spirit Crucible Elpys in particular, once you get there, warp first to the Canyon of Husks landmark (which warps you to the Spirit Crucible Elpys landmark), then you can go to the inn and level up as needed. The Spirit Crucible Entrance landmark is required in order to receive your bonus xp and SP for this area. This is a known issue that currently has no workaround !!

You also get a large amount of SP for the Driver Skill Tree at the First and Third Storyline sections of the game.

The XP gained from fighting higher level enemies is increased. The damage taken modifier when fighting higher level enemies is capped at 200%.

If the "Guaranteed Rare Blades" option is on, Rare Blades will unlock their Blade Skill Tree ranks by reaching the first landmark of the Second and Fourth Storyline sections. So when you reach the Anangham #2 Dock landmark in Mor Ardain, for example, all Rare Blades unlock the second and third levels of their skill trees. 

The SP Cost of your all skills on your Hidden Skill trees are reduced by 80%.

------------------------------------------------------------

Shop Changes:

If this setting is on, Shynini (of the Argentum Trade Guild, F1) will sell Common, Rare, and Legendary Core Crystals.

Additionally, the Shop Deeds you get for buying all items in a shop are removed, as they are intended to be shuffled into the pool of treasure chests with the Zohar Fragment Hunt setting.

All Shop Deeds now give a 5% movement speed buff.

The amount of each Pouch Item you can carry is increased to a minimum of 10.

------------------------------------------------------------

Custom Loot:

This option replaces all chest loot on Race Mode continents with custom loot tables containing accessories, weapon manuals, pre-completed aux cores, weapon chips, and more. "Movespeed Deeds" are also added to the pool, each granting a 5% increase to your movement speed. When this option is on, note that enemies will only drop gold, so seeking out these chests is your main method of increasing your character power level!

If the option "Custom Core Crystals" is on, then custom Core Crystals containing specific Rare Blades will also be shuffled into the pool. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Guaranteed Rare Blades (no longer a Race Mode exclusive feature, still included for clarity, as it does have effects on Race Mode if enabled):

If this option is on, and "Custom Loot" is on, the gacha system is disabled, and Rare Blades are instead obtained by opening custom Core Crystals, found in the loot pool.

If this option is on, and the "Less Grinding" option is on, then Rare Blades will unlock their Blade Skill Tree ranks by reaching the first landmark of a Storyline section. So when you reach the Forgotten Waste landmark in Gormott, all Rare Blades unlock the second level of their skill trees. 

DLC-exclusive blades are released from the Land of Challenge restriction, allowing you to use them anywhere without beating the appropriate Challenge Battle. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Starting Items:

You start with all 5 drivers with their associated blades (Pyra/Mythra, Dromarch, Poppy α, PoppyQT, PoppyQTπ, Pandoria, Brighid).

You start with 100000g.
