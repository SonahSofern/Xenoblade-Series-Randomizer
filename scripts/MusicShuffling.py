# RSC_BgmCondition:
# An area usually has 2-3 conditions. If it has 3, its a weather related condition (music is adjusted for weather), usually can tell via large condition value
# condition of 454 is daytime
# condition of 453 is night time
# condition of 1 is debug area, only one this is tied to is gormott area theme
# priority column, value 0 is highest priority, will always play if given a choice of multiple songs. prio goes down as prio # goes up
# I don't know what causes the cave music and gormott lower music to play over other themes tbh.
# Torna fight themes overlap with base game file names ("m0x.wav"->"m2x.wav"), so you can't use them as enemy battle themes in the base game because those point to other themes used in cutscenes in the game.

# Adding new IDs doesn't seem to work
# Reusing other IDs also doesn't seem to work
# Looking like you won't be able to hear all battle themes in game
# So then we keep CHR_EnArrange the same, and randomize the .wav files and place a set number of them into the IDs that work with CHR_EnArrange
