# Setup

### Requirements:
[Python v3.11.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)\
Legal Dump of Xenoblade 2 Switch v2.1.0 + All DLC\
Homebrewed Switch or Emulator\
[NXDumpTool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool)\
[Xenoblade 2 Set](https://gbatemp.net/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-2-graphics-settings.529436/)

### Console Also Requires:
microSD card (A 32GB minimum exFAT-formatted microSD card is recommended; FAT32 seems to mess stuff up.)\
Modded Nintendo Switch with Atmosphere


### Process:
Guide adapted from: https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13815 

1. CONSOLE ONLY: Use NXDumpTool to perform a full dump of XC2's RomFS to your microSD card, and put it into your computer.
2. EMULATOR ONLY: Use your emulator's built-in tool to perform a full dump of XC2's RomFS. If given the option, select 0100E95004038000.
3. Locate "bf2.ard" and "bf2.arh"; those are the only two important files.
> **IMPORTANT:** if your sdcard is formatted as fat32, bf2.ard might be split into a folder with multiple files inside. In this case you will have to combine them.\
> Open a command prompt and navigate to your bf2.ard folder\
> Depending on your OS run the following command:\
> **Windows: `copy /b` file1name `+` file2name `+` file3name `bf2.ard`\
> **Mac/Linux: `cat` file1name file2name file3name `> bf2.ard`\
> You should have the combined file now!
4. Download Xenoblade2Set from (https://gbatemp.net/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-2-graphics-settings.529436/), and extract its contents.
5. Copy bf2.ard and bf2.arh to the Xenoblade2Set folder, and run "quickbms_4gb_files.exe".
6. It will ask for a "bms script"; select Xenoblade2ard.bms. It will then ask for "archives/files"; select bf2.arh. For "output folder", go into the empty "modified" folder and press "Save". The files should extract, it may take a bit. NOTE: You can stop the program once all the GB files are finished. The rest is just for the other languages.
7. There should now be a new "bdat" folder inside "modified"; This is the folder that the randomizer program targets as the input folder. The output folder should be\
FOR YUZU: C:/Users/yourName/AppData/Roaming/yuzu/load/0100E95004039001/Randomizer/romfs/bdat\
FOR RYUJINX: C:/Users/yourName/AppData/Roaming/Ryujinx/sdcard/atmosphere/contents/0100e95004039001/romfs/bdat\
FOR CONSOLE: This PC/Nintendo Switch/SD Card/atmosphere/contents/0100E95004039001/romfs/bdat (This is on your microsd card)\
NOTE: You will have to create the 0100E95004039001 folder.
8. Choose your preferred settings, then use the randomizer program to randomize the contents of the game.
9. CONSOLE ONLY: Put your microSD card back into your Switch and Launch the game. Pressing L bypasses the active patches, so if you wish to play the vanilla game again, you can do so in this way.
10. You should be ready to start playing!
